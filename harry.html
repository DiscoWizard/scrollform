<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:14 PM<br>
</em>hello, I'm sword, and I make art of dubious quantity and quality</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:14 PM</em><br>
Hi I'm harry, I do basically the same thing</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:14 PM</em><br>
about since when have you existed on the internet?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:15 PM</em><br>
I've been using the internet for a long time, but I can clearly recognise my first time as being 'online' as we know it to 11 years old</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:15 PM</em><br>
where did you first exist then? was there any particular site?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:17 PM</em><br>
I was watching kids cartoons a lot, and I used to google them religiously after I watched them. One day I stumbled across fanfiction.net and it seemed to me to be ENDLESS content for the cartoons I had been watching.</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:18 PM</em><br>
that's pretty much the holy grail to getting into fandom haha</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:18 PM</em><br>
I can see why<br>
I think there's a kind of personality that gets very absorbed into stories, and things like fan fiction, amvs or fan content feels like a way to extend the magic into eternity</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:21 PM</em><br>
I definitely feel that, you never want to stop experiencing those stories!</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:21 PM<br>
</em>Yep!</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:21 PM</em><br>
Did you comment on any of the fanfics you read?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:22 PM</em><br>
I think so? There used to be a 'comment if you want more' trend and I used to comment, because I wanted more<br>
I mostly lurked though</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:23 PM</em><br>
Very fair<br>
Was there a point at which you started to interact directly with others online?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:24 PM</em><br>
Yep! Same site at around 12, I think I found my first 'send me your OC and I'll put them in the story'<br>
I was in loooooove with that, and I started making my own characters and sending them to the author, then checking back every day to see if my character was in yet<br>
They would show up for like a paragraph and I would lose my mind every time</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:26 PM</em><br>
Oh man that would be the peak of my existence at 12<br>
Was that still on fanfiction.net?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:26 PM<br>
</em>Yep! I never moved to livejournal or wattpad thank god</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:27 PM</em><br>
YEAH definitely best for a youngster</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:27 PM</em><br>
I think at like, age 13-14 I started drawing and I was pretty good at it<br>
So that's when I joined deviantart</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:28 PM</em><br>
dun DUN</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:28 PM</em><br>
The secret come out</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:29 PM</em><br>
I think a lot of internet artists from that time can definitely relate, it was kind of The art site combined social space</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:29 PM</em><br>
Yep and it was the best one at that time<br>
I was born in 1995, so when I was on deviantart it was like, 2007-9</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:32 PM</em><br>
Did you talk to other people on deviantart then?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:33 PM</em><br>
I did! It was a lot more engaged</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:33 PM</em><br>
What was that like?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:33 PM</em><br>
Mostly fine! The audience there was overwhelmingly young for the most part<br>
I had my first weird interactions with adults<br>
But mostly just posting my OCs and being very happy if I got one comment<br>
I didn't really participate in any big community activities I was scared shitless of stranger danger<br>
Which, wise, because my closest online 'friend' at the time was 21</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:35 PM</em><br>
Ah!</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:35 PM</em><br>
Mhmmm<br>
He still messages me lol</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:36 PM</em><br>
I hope in a nice older friend way and not in a creepy way jeez</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:36 PM</em><br>
He seemed nice! But it was a bit weird he was friends with an 11 year old</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:37 PM</em><br>
Augh yeah<br>
Especially with sites like deviantart it was always interesting to see who reached out for better or for the more uncomfortable</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:38 PM</em><br>
Yep<br>
This part of my online life is kind of boring tbh<br>
I was mostly super passive</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:38 PM</em><br>
Ohoh, when would you say it got more interesting?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:38 PM</em><br>
Oh god not for wayyyyy later<br>
I read homestuck in 2010, and I got a lot better at art at that point<br>
I joined tumblr because that's where the homestuck people seemed to be<br>
And I posted for a while until I did my first fan art that got 1k likes<br>
And that was it for me lol that was the crack cocaine my brain craved</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:40 PM</em><br>
those likes get addictive IMMEDIATELY</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:40 PM</em><br>
I started drawing a LOT, still not very good because I was like barely 15<br>
But I got more followers and people actually commented on my rambling posts<br>
I made a friend who was my age and we talked a lot, I sent them fanart and they sent me fics we made for each other<br>
And I found out I was gay! So I retreated a LOT into online</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:42 PM</em><br>
That will definitely lead to that</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:43 PM</em><br>
That was probably the first time I became AWARE of the disconnect between myself and the people around me<br>
I was always super awkward and I'd been getting a lot more awkward as I grew up and realised I just wasn't very good at being social, or that I had much in common with other girls<br>
But in a place like tumblr, being gay was so uncontroversial even in 2009 that it was very easy to come to terms with it in that environment<br>
But it was NOT okay in my school, or my house<br>
There wasn't a single other openly lgbt kid in my grade, even now I think there was like only one other who came out after school and we never talked<br>
So that whole 'double life' thing got very real</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:47 PM</em><br>
Did it become harder to keep them cleanly separated as you were able to be out online, or easier with having that outlet?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:47 PM</em><br>
Kind of the opposite, I got very good at compartmentalising, nobody even knew I had a blog<br>
I only ever really told my therapists about it, my mum knew my internet stuff because she kept tabs on everything but my parents weren't interested in my art so I kind of skated by</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:48 PM</em><br>
That's nice at least</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:49 PM<br>
</em>Hahahahaha<br>
Yeah it worked<br>
Kid me had the right idea, that school sucked and I was not a tough cookie I couldn't have handled homophobia<br>
Or transphobia, god I had so many egg moments at that age<br>
But I had no idea what trans people were at the time sooo</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:51 PM</em><br>
Did you end up having different kinds of friends in school/offline than you made online?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:53 PM<br>
</em>Like different kinds of people?</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:53 PM</em><br>
yes!</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:53 PM</em><br>
Yes absolutely<br>
The people I had to pick from in school was very limited<br>
I went to a private school, we had maybe 100 people in the grade max<br>
My friends were mostly friends of my BEST friend who was very protective of me, without her I don't think I really would have had any<br>
But online you're allowed to talk to anyone so of course!<br>
I talked to dorky queers all day</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:55 PM</em><br>
The dream</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:55 PM</em><br>
I'm doing it right now :)</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:55 PM</em><br>
//UuU//</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:56 PM</em><br>
Did you want to move past high school?</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:56 PM</em><br>
Now that you're older, would you say those lines have started to blur more?<br>
you read my mind lol</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:56 PM</em><br>
Hehehe<br>
Yeah<br>
I got online brain very clearly in 2015-6, when overwatch came out<br>
I had made some friends online who were actually local and we hung out, and I posted art that got SUPER popular<br>
I made a bunch of comics and people interacted with them constantly, ended up with like 20k followers within a month and IMMEDIATELY disabled the ask box</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 9:58 PM</em><br>
Smart</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 9:59 PM</em><br>
Yeah, so I was kind of freaked out by how many eyes were on me<br>
Obviously I had never really dealt with anything like that before<br>
And I joined a discord with people who promised to be chill, and there were other artists there that I admired<br>
And voila<br>
You have the harry of today, basically unchanged</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:01 PM</em><br>
So innn 2013 I was drugged and assaulted, and they used ketamine<br>
And I spent like, 2 years in a very foggy haze not really doing well in school and being a bit of a shithead<br>
And when I came out of that, and it was time to face being gay, and being traumatised, and being gender, real life was just too much<br>
Online was such a balm it really felt like an escape<br>
I would just draw for hours and hours and forget to eat, and talk on the discord and read fanfiction<br>
It was super unhealthy but I had become like a different person in those 2 years there was basically zero desire to see what else life had to throw at me</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:06 PM</em><br>
Being able to go into a place removed from your physical self is really addictive</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:07 PM</em><br>
It is!<br>
It was coping, and I wasn't in an environment where I was around people who were like me, and if I ever met them at cons or stuff there was usually a huge disconnect because you know<br>
I've lived a bit of a life, and a lot of white online cis people haven't really lived that<br>
So I would talk about doing drugs, or getting into fights, or stealing shit or casual sex and it was like, a chasm in front of me and everyone else<br>
I had one foot in one life and one foot in the other and I didn't belong in either<br>
I still feel that way</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:11 PM</em><br>
I'm sorry you had to go through that <br>
And then to get out the other side and end up isolated because of it too is a real nice added salt in the wound</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:12 PM</em><br>
It's cathartic to look back and get bitter about how I got fucked up, but honestly the only upsetting thing is how hard it is to connect with people<br>
I actually really like who I am<br>
If it was just my own company forever that'd be okay I think</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:14 PM</em><br>
I honestly feel a bit similar sometimes. Coming from a weird family situation, I'd see someone online briefly mention something super specific and I still think about it, that someone else might understand even a small part of me</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:14 PM</em><br>
Yeah<br>
It's an intoxicating thought</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:15 PM</em><br>
And it's a bit easier to find those snippets of connection online than in person, at least in my experience. even though then it's hard to build a connection or ask more about it</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:15 PM</em><br>
Sometimes shit happens and you feel yourself detach just a bit more from people who live comfortable lives<br>
Yeah I think with online people are looking for each other<br>
And it's easier to find other people<br>
I've kind of slid back into that state I mentioned earlier where I'm not really doing anything other than being online, post the disaster that was me coming out as trans<br>
But now I'm making money doing it so $$$$$$$$$$</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:17 PM</em><br>
Money Always Fixes Everything<br>
Or at least is nice validation :sob:</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:18 PM</em><br>
Makes it a bit easier, I do enjoy eating</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:20 PM</em><br>
Do you see yourself coming to a place where even if you're spending more time online, you feel healthier doing it?<br>
Or trying to find that balance of off and on</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:20 PM</em><br>
Healthier than before? Of course<br>
I think it's generally unhealthy to spend all day in your room<br>
And I think socialization outside of online helps you keep the balance<br>
But that need for a community is a lot stronger than it was when I was 14 because now I don't really have anyone</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:22 PM</em><br>
Once you're an adult you don't really get that built in school socialization</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:23 PM</em><br>
I got back from Korea and broke up with my bf after he hit me, I came out to my parents and they kicked me out, my brother is in Copenhagen, my best friends are in Korea or went back to their home countries, I have basically one close friend and he's moving away in 6 months<br>
So yeah I'm pretty isolated<br>
And now that I'm trans making friends is an absolute nightmare, I was very social a couple months ago but I've abandoned that after a few really bad encounters</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:29 PM</em><br>
With all the risks and the pull of online it def feels safer sometimes than running the gamut of bigotry and physical risk offline.</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:30 PM</em><br>
Yep<br>
I've turtled up a lot</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:30 PM</em><br>
We need to figure out instant blocking for real life</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:31 PM</em><br>
I should be allowed to mute men</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:32 PM</em><br>
That would solve like a good 10% of my problems. I've similarly seen myself not wanting to bother with the effort of offline friendship and social life<br>
Do you find yourself acting a particular way online vs offline? How you interact with people differently?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:35 PM</em><br>
Ummmm I'm nicer online<br>
There's a lot of things like content warnings and stuff that have me like Concerned about people's health and safety<br>
Bruh when I say I don't give a shit about telling people they're cunts irl I'm not lying</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:36 PM</em><br>
Sometimes they need to know</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:36 PM</em><br>
I'm like 'why don't a have any friends :pensive: '<br>
I know why, it's because the patience for people in my life has bottomed out</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:37 PM</em><br>
Do you think you're able to be more patient online? Or it just doesn't come up as much</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:37 PM</em><br>
I just like you guys more<br>
Like, genuinely<br>
People in our discord are funnier and sweeter and gentler with me<br>
I want to pay that back and take care of you guys<br>
I don't care about cis men.<br>
And even cis women, I'll cut them some more slack but I'll call them out too</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:39 PM</em><br>
You definitely deserve better treatment</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:39 PM</em><br>
:heart:<br>
You want to know what the number one most common thing I hear from these people is?</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:39 PM</em><br>
Oh?</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:40 PM</em><br>
'You should try and understand that your parents are just having a hard time with this'</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:40 PM</em><br>
WOW</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:40 PM</em><br>
Maybe a half dozen times in the last 6 months</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:40 PM</em><br>
Thats so shitty</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:41 PM</em><br>
It sucks, but it's because they don't know<br>
Because the people I want to be around DO know<br>
But those people are ONLINE and not in MY TERRIBLE CITY</p>

<p><strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 10:42 PM</em><br>
As is the curse of offline</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong> <em>Today at 10:42 PM</em><br>
Fuck offline<br>
I want my friends ;-;</p>
