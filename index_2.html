  <h4>admittedly ive had a lot of social fails online</h4>

  <strong>carmi</strong><em> Today at 5:08 PM<br>
    </em>hi im carmi. i run <a href="http://spicyyeti.com/" target="_blank" >spicyyeti.com</a> and make webcomics<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 5:09 PM</em><br>
    about since when have you been on the internet?<br>
    either your first overall experiences or really getting Online.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi</strong> <em>Today at 5:11 PM</em><br>
    sgaljsalgjsd well one of my first internet memories was being shown the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5uujMb_hbo">veggie tales bellybutton song on youtube</a> in 2006. but i really got On the internet in 2008 when i stole my moms new laptop<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:12 PM</em><br>
    LMAO i feel like there's so much skirting of parents with being on the internet as a kid, I always had to get on the computer when my dad was busy with other stuff<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:12 PM<br>
    </em>AGHASGJ THATS KINDA TRUE for the first few years i was online my computer was in the same room as my moms but it was facing away from hers so AGASDK I JUST ALWAYS MADE SURE TO HAVE MY VOLUME DOWN<br><br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:13 PM</em><br>
    you didn't have headphones?<br>
    actually nvm i remember not having headphones either<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:13 PM</em><br>
    I THINK I FIRST GOT HEADPHONES IN 2012 AHGDSK<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:14 PM</em><br>
    HONESTLY similar, i feel like now ive always used headphones (i dont even own speakers for my computer) but we really just had audio playing for the whole room didn't we<br>
    or on the lowest volume and holding the speaker to my ear<br>
    Being on the internet itself since 2008, when would you say you started being really social online?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:17 PM</em><br>
    i got online in late 2008 and by 2009 i had started using this website called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank" >scratch.mit.edu</a> <br>
    i found it because i wanted to find the original club penguin "penguin chat" demo or whatever the hell it was called<br>
    and someone had recreated it in scratch<br>
    so i guess i technically mustve been using <a href="https://cprewritten.net/" target="_blank" >club penguin</a> before i got on scratch AFKL;AS IDK<br>
    but yeah both of those sites were extremely social for me<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:18 PM</em><br>
    i think i get the gist of club penguin, but what was scratch.mit.edu like?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi</strong> <em>Today at 5:19 PM</em><br>
    so scratch is a site developed by MIT used to teach kids how to program<br>
    i think for the most part kids are introduced to it in school but i happened to find it on my own<br>
    back then you would make an account, download the program, and make and upload projects in it<br>
    your and others peoples projects were viewable in-browser (and nowadays the program itself is in-browser too)<br>
    kids pretty much had free reign to comment on each others projects, interact in the forums, even organize meetups and share their skypes and such AHKGHSAKGJ IT WAS HONESTLY KINDA CHAOTIC EVEN WITH ADULT MODERATORS TRYING TO KEEP THE PEACE<br>
    IN MY FIRST PROJECT I ASKED FOR PEOPLES ADDRESSES<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:21 PM</em><br>
    LMAOO<br>
    that is so interesting, ive honestly never heard of that!<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:22 PM</em><br>
    IT WAS A REALLY INTERESTING SITE TO GROW UP ON<br>
    another funny feature scratch has is "remixing" peoples projects<br>
    ideally youre supposed to do it like forking in github jsdfjsda like using it to improve on someones code i think<br>
    BUT NOBODY ACTUALLY KNEW HOW THE HELL TO CODE AT ALL AND 99% OF THE TIME IT WAS USED TO BLATANTLY STEAL AND RECOLOR PEOPLES PROJECTS HASDGASKG
  <img class="imge" src="images/carmi/bw.png">
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:23 PM</em><br>
    getting kids into copyright theft early on<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:23 PM</em><br>
    LITERALLY we'd just put copyrighted music in our projects and write "credit to whoever made this"<br>
    WE REALLY WROTE THAT<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 5:23 PM</em><br>
    NICE<br>
    were your profiles basically your real names/selves?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:25 PM</em><br>
    not at all agsjgks to this day im a little shocked that its normal to use your real name on <a href="https://twitter.com/">twitter</a><br>
    everyone went by a username<br>
    everyone had an avatar (usually an anthro)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:25 PM</em><br>
    mine was a cat<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:25 PM</em><br>
    did they have anthros to choose from or did you just upload your own picture?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:26 PM</em><br>
    they did not have anthros to choose from. the starting assets from scratch were all these really ugly characters or straight up cutout photographs of real kids GDASKJGASKJGSADJKSAGJK SO YEAH it was expected you would design your own anthro<br>
    socially though there were like<br>
    A FEW MAIN SPECIES TO CHOOSE FROM<br>
    there were the cats, mostly kids who were <a href="https://warriorcats.com/">warriors</a> fans<br>
    there were hamsters and idk where they got that idea but yeah there were hamsters<br>
    and there were tokis? takis?? they were lizard creatures designed by a notable scratcher<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:28 PM</em><br>
    were there more social threads or was it strictly project based?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:32 PM</em><br>
    there were forums i didnt know how to work as a kid ghjhkjsg one of the people on the <a href="https://www.spicyyeti.com/GODHEAD/ACT_1/prologue/1.html">godhead</a> music team actually frequented the scratch forums as a kid and theyre still a part of a social group that came out of that fdlsaflk im also still a part of my social group that came out of the projects. its funny to me these unique social strains came out of the same website and same time period<br>
    we were coexisting and Didnt Even Know<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:33 PM</em><br>
    small internet...<br>
    were there any other social-ish sites you used/currently use?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:35 PM</em><br>
    after scratch i got on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/">deviantart</a> and id say thats where i spent the bulk of my time on the internet somehow?? fks;lfksl;a i rarely socialized with anyone who werent my friends from scratch cuz deviantart is full of weird fetish people but it was a good site to develop as an artist<br>
    oh wait i did use <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> in its heyday<br>
    i was not active on tumblr i joined to look at <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/">homestuck</a> fanart<br>
    and similarly i joined twitter in 2019 to look at homestuck fanart
  <img class="imge" src="images/carmi/color.png">
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:36 PM</em><br>
    it do be like that<br>
    were you mostly social offline then?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:38 PM</em><br>
    not really AHGASHJGKSA ive always been kind of a shutin. after i formed a solid group of friends on scratch i just stuck with them until PRETTY MUCH LAST YEAR<br>
    theyre still my friends, what i mean is i didnt branch out socially much until recently<br>
    though of course i had school friends<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:39 PM</em><br>
    would you say your friends from scratch were similar to the friends you made at school?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:40 PM</em><br>
    not really? the friends you meet online youre able to filter out more whereas the ones you meet at school sometimes youre stuck with circumstantially DSAHGUGHUDHKASGHJASK<br>
    i found it easier to bond with specific people online<br>
    at school i didnt form many close bonds, i just kinda tried to keep a good reputation and not much else<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:41 PM</em><br>
    that's very fair! it can be stressful, especially with school having more professional consequences.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:41 PM</em><br>
    the older you get yeah<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 5:42 PM</em><br>
    and you've kept a pretty consistent online "brand"/persona over the years, right?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:43 PM</em><br>
    id say so. i think the ways i interact online can be categorized in either the carmi persona or the spicyyeti persona<br>
    spicyyeti came in 2015<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:45 PM</em><br>
    how would you differentiate those two personas?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:46 PM</em><br>
    the carmi one is like a concentrated version of my personality...its like what i use to talk to people online openly and freely<br>
    the spicyyeti one is more something i use to advertise my work? i find it comically aggressive and i wouldnt use it to actually talk TO anyone. its more just an announcer voice, a way to present read-only information<br>
    since spicyyeti for me is a site that represents me in a way that people can only look at, not interact with.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:50 PM</em><br>
    <a href="http://spicyyeti.com/">spicyyeti</a> is your personal work site, correct?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:50 PM</em><br>
    yup<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:51 PM</em><br>
    what kind of things do you post on spicyyeti?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi</strong> <em>Today at 5:52 PM</em><br>
    PRETTY MUCH WHATEVER I WANT....................the four main links are "home", "art", "stories", and "about"<br>
    but there are a ton of hidden links that lead to a bunch of random bullshit as well<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:55 PM</em><br>
    Do you find any way that the internet or the sites you use don't host yourself in a way you wish they could?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 5:56 PM</em><br>
    like do i wish i could represent myself as clearly on other sites as i do on spicyyeti??<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:58 PM</em><br>
    when presenting yourself in either the carmi or spicyyeti role, do the different sites/programs you use for each one fail in some way, or do you wish that they had some additional/different functionality to present yourself exactly as you'd intend?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 6:02 PM</em><br>
    oh ok well i guess i dont have much constructive criticism for other sites since i can just go to my own and do what i want dshagjkg like i accept that presenting myself in an isolated environment such as my own site is going to afford me more freedom than socializing with others through ANY interface, whether online or irl<br>
    admittedly ive had a lot of social fails online but as janky as any of the social media platforms we have to choose from are i dont really blame the platform when that happens<br>
    i think socializing is just a mess no matter where you go AGASGHKJSAGDSA<br>
    <br>
    <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 6:05 PM</em><br>
    but yeah, i feel that<br>
    do you find yourself preferring your own web space over traditional social media?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>carmi </strong><em>Today at 6:08 PM</em><br>
    i used to but now i feel its optimal to have both<br>
    as much as i do spicyyeti for myself i wouldnt publish it if i didnt want others to see it dsafhs im glad people on twitter have shown interest<br>
    im also glad i can actually talk to people on twitter and watch their shenanigans as well ;safksf;lsa

  <h4>if you're gay it's not like anybody can do anything about it</h4>

  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 8:26 PM</em><br>
  Heya! I'm rads and i'm a digital artist and kind - of - writer.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 8:26 PM</em><br>
  we love artists here<br>
  about since when have you been on the internet?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 8:30 PM</em><br>
  I want to say 2007-2008 but i have a feeling it may be even earlier than that, i learned how to read when i was really young so id be fussing around <a href="https://jspaint.app/#local:708388d70f0cb">mspaint</a> for hours on end while looking at pictures of my favorite cartoon characters lol<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 8:31 PM</em><br>
  that's the life tbh, i want to go back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads</strong> <em>Today at 8:34 PM</em><br>
  A simpler time in the internet<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord</strong> <em>Today at 8:35 PM</em><br>
  what were your first social experiences on the internet like?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 8:38 PM</em><br>
  Dressup dolls game hubs with little forums (i didnt participate in those so much as peek over the topics), <a href="http://www.neopets.com/">Neopets</a>, and <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/">pokemon</a> fansites were pretty much my roaming range, i even had an unused <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us">MSN</a> account that only ever got to share messages with my mom<br>
  This was still on the period where adults would warn you about strangers online so even when i started to peek at flash files on <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/">newgrounds</a> i struggled to engage, and mostly lurked on creator and user pages up until i was like... 9? I think<br>
  <img class="imge" src="images/rads/cool.png">
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 8:41 PM</em><br>
  what changed for you then?<br>
  or maybe changed about the internet?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 8:45 PM</em><br>
  It was a mix between my family moving around for the second time since i was born and me losing contact with my old schoolfriends, and social games like <a href="https://www.habbo.com/">Habbo Hotel</a> and less known variants cropping up all over the place<br>
  They looked really shiny. For someone on the cusp of being 10 years old it was like oh yeah, this is neopet for teens<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 8:46 PM</em><br>
  The Cooler Neopets<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 8:46 PM</em><br>
  "In this one you can have pool parties!"<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 8:46 PM</em><br>
  oh wow<br>
  did you talk to other kids there more?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 8:48 PM</em><br>
  I suspect so yeah i think a lot of us were playing an extended roleplay game of pretending to be older than we really were<br>
  Most claiming to be fifteen years old at the time would then happily engage with you for hours on erudite topics like, <a href="https://ben10.fandom.com/wiki/Ben_10">ben 10</a>, so youd rarely get discovered<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 8:50 PM</em><br>
  all that googling cartoon characters really starting to pay off i bet<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads</strong> <em>Today at 8:50 PM</em><br>
  That was the tutorial stage i had to beat to join society<br>
  Very important<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 8:51 PM</em><br>
  how would you say your social interactions have grown online?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 9:00 PM</em><br>
  I think learning to speak english opened up a whole half of the web that wasn't disponible to me before, even when it was still rusty and id have to google translate file names before downloading videogame <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ROM-emulation">roms</a>. Casual stuff like social games would get boring quick or become repetitive (besides walking around and paying to own pretty things, there wasnt much content to the minigames) and searching for anything related to media i enjoyed would deposit me on english speaking websites if i wanted to see new things<br>
  I went from barely logging into <a href="https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2020/12/25/video-games-change-the-way-you-feel-about-the-world-and-yourself/">Orkut</a> (i think this social media died off by now? It was a brazillian alternative to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">facebook</a> when that was still in its infancy) to look at family pictures to spending HOURS looking through any and all fandom related sites and fanblogs i could find<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 9:03 PM</em><br>
  was a lot of the media you were interested in primarily based in english?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 9:06 PM</em><br>
  Yeah! Brazillian entertainment is very ... adult oriented? even when we're talking about national shows for kids the pull ends up being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenovela">telenovela-style</a> drama between the teachers or parent figures<br>
  To make up for that most channels imported their cartoons, preteen series and animes to be dubbed and shown in matinee programs or afternoon blocks for kids<br>
  Here you either study in the morning or in the afternoon, so the matinees were for kids who woke up at 11 to get ready for school while the afternoon blocks were for the kids who studied in the morning and spent the rest of the day dicking around in the house<br>
  The end result was that most stuff i got into had its news written up in a totally different language, but when the reruns refuse to show you new season episodes you have to get a little creative<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 9:12 PM</em><br>
  that's really interesting that more of the entertainment was towards adults<br>
  do you think your early language barrier effect how you interacted with/presented yourself to others in the english online spaces?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 9:16 PM</em><br>
  It definitely did<br>
  I'd try to make my digital footprint smaller, if that makes sense? I still couldn't understand a good 60% of the complex language being utilized and it was just made worse by all sorts of internetspeak and abbreviations that depended on cultural knowledge<br>
  I got the habit of lurking around and absorbing as much information as i could but only inserting myself into conversations to give brief feedback in the form of compliments<br>
  It was a little easier to bullshit spanish so id halve my time looking for links and threads and news in latin fanclubs and watch how they bullshitted english in turn<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 9:23 PM</em><br>
  you speak Portuguese, right?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads</strong><em> Today at 9:24 PM</em><br>
  Yep! Brazillian portuguese, it's different from the one they speak in europe<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 9:27 PM</em><br>
  Were there a lot of spaces online that used it? Or what were those spaces like (other than Orkut I guess).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 9:30 PM</em><br>
  Early 2010's brazillian internet feels very empty to me, partly because not a lot of people saw a "use" for it. Phones were huge, we love phones, but pre-facebook you'd struggle to find a computer in most modest households. It was an expensive and clunky thing to own that didn't come with localized instructions<br>
  Even printing stuff was reserved to "Xerox places" and a lot of people made money on mounting like 10 pcs on their garage and charging 1 real per hour of use<br>
  So you'd see a lot of websites for brands and newspapers but social stuff wasn't popularized or accessible, at least not in the way i see people talk about livejournal or myspace as part of their teen years<br>
  I got my first phone when i was 10 years old and at that point (2011~ onwards) is when the novelty of social media started to become a real hot topic, and i even found brazillian focused fanfic sites eventually - but as far as fanfics go, those are also often adult leaning<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 9:38 PM</em><br>
  how would you say that's transformed to how you use the internet today?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 9:41 PM</em><br>
  I think it taught me to read and research a lot, to the point that's still how i spend most of my time online<br>
  Fansites and fanclubs introduced me to community based fanart so i finally had an excuse to draw things with intent and for a public, which i still do to this day, and it's the stuff I'm primarily known for<br>
  Though now that im secure enough to hold a conversation ive moved from an expectator to an active actor who can directly interact with the things i enjoy and their creators<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 9:47 PM</em><br>
  do you try to present yourself a particular way to other creators or communities online?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 9:52 PM</em><br>
  Yeah! I'm a lot more polished than i am in real life, and i guess more aproachable? I like having the option to communicate thru text to express things more clearly<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 9:53 PM</em><br>
  I definitely relate to that lol<br>
  Do you find large differences between the people you interact with online verses offline?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 9:59 PM</em><br>
  IRL most of my contacts can be summed up with school related classmates or family, and i end up losing contact with people when/if i move places because a lot of the appeal in those acquaintances is being able to hang out instead of shared interests<br>
  On the flipside theres a few people online ive known for years and whom ive seen grow from place to place, most of which are artists themselves or into some sort of creative hobby. By and large, they're often part of the lgbt community one way or another too
  <img class="imge" src="images/rads/hands.gif">
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 10:05 PM</em><br>
  How would you say being a part of the LGBT community effected the difference between your online and offline identities?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>rads </strong><em>Today at 10:10 PM</em><br>
  It helped a lot to have somewhere to discuss these sort of personal and touchy topics that wasn't out in the open, i think i got very lucky choosing the communities i visited and was able to catch the development of a lot of hubs focused on exploring gay characters and non-cishet identities. If it wasn't for that, i doubt id even be the same person i am today, online and offline. I still havent found anything quite like that in real life, if you aren't from big cities or capitals the gay part of the population is like... hiding under rocks. Out of necessity more than anything<br>
  The "Everyone is a stranger" warning ends up working in your favour once you realize in the internet, nobody knows who you are, so if you claim to be a boy you're a boy, and if you're gay it's not like anybody can do anything about it<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 10:20 PM</em><br>
  It is nice, to not have to convince people of things like that.<br>
  It's a relief!<br>
  <br>
  <strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 10:22 PM</em><br>
  Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?<br>
  <br>

  Not much tbh... i guess just that if the pandemic months have proven anything is how much digital support and socialization can go a long way to make sure you don't go stir crazy LOL<br>

  AH yeah. It's a ride seeing "irl" people adapt to online socialization more.<br>

  Hopefully this settles the age old dispute on whether or not internet friends count as "real" friendship, i think that one is way past its expiration date

  <h4>it was a shitty site and it was basically the wild west</h4>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:09 PM<br>
  </em>i'm riley and i'm a 20 year old university student</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:10 PM<br>
  </em>about since when have you existed on the internet?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:13 PM<br>
  </em>from probably around 2006 i have memories of the internet but no accounts of my own. following that had restricted internet access from the ages of 8 to 14 (2008-2014) and have had unlimited internet access from then onward. i can remember creating my first account on a website in 2008 and have had many since then.</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:13 PM<br>
  </em>what kinds of sites did you make accounts on at first?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:16 PM<br>
  </em>my first account i made was on <a href="https://www.webkinz.com/">webkinz</a> and i remember it vividly because i still use the same password! following that i was very active on <a href="http://www.neopets.com/">neopets</a> and particularly the discussion forums on neopets. <a href="https://twitter.com/">twitter</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com/">youtube</a> were also introduced early, along with email and social music sharing sites (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/30/8526105/grooveshark-shuts-down-settles-with-labels">grooveshark</a>) that no longer exist. i briefly remember being active on <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/">livejournal</a> as well as a few other forums but i quickly moved on from that to more mainstream social media.</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:17 PM<br>
  </em>what was neopets like?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:21 PM<br>
  </em>it's interesting to look back as an adult because neopets was literally just a heavily modded forum. i was the youngest person i knew there and lied about my age (to the tune of adding ten entire years) because everyone i knew there was in uni and my middle school in response felt weird. there were two separate boards i frequented. one when i was younger which was more so a "whatever you want" type board where you could start a chat thread about pretty much anything (child appropriate) and just kind of pray that people would reply. a lot of this was early fandom and general media stuff and fanbase scragglers at the time who didn't find homes elsewhere, i suppose. the other board was more geared towards the actual game and trading/bartering pets which i assume is irrelevant.</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:22 PM<br>
  </em>Lying about being older online is definitely common lol</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:23 PM<br>
  </em>yeah it's concerning in retrospect but i don't know how to make it seem concerning from jump. that's the question isn't it.<em><br>
  </em>for people currently engaging in it that is</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:24 PM<br>
  </em>yeah, it's interesting! did you have specific ways you tried to pretend to be older, or only when ages were brought up?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:26 PM<br>
  </em>oh absolutely! i actually recently got back into my old account and i had a fake major listed as well as constant chatter all over my page about the girlfriend i had had at the time (my 8th grade girlfriend) where i exaggerated the length and closeness of our relationship (cus it wasn't that long or close because we were in 8TH GRADE) as well as using catfish pictures to represent myself. at some point i also started making secondary accounts to be my friends which was really going too far but. honesty is honesty and it's been years and that's true lol. i think that was after neopets though.</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:27 PM<br>
  </em>Wow that's so elaborate, though kind of genius for selling it?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:27 PM<br>
  </em>thanks i'm naturally a very committed person. i think it's the adhd lol. i wanted to fit in soooo bad.</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:28 PM<br>
  </em>You say making the extra accounts was after neopets, was that on more mainstream social media then?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:30 PM<br>
  </em>no thank god. i don't think that ever reached twitter that was on whatever sites i was flitting around on in the interim between them.<em><br>
  </em>grooveshark i guess but literally no one knows what that is anymore</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:30 PM<br>
  </em>Tell me about grooveshark!<em><br>
  </em>Because you're right, I have no idea what that is lol.</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:32 PM<br>
  </em>grooveshark was basically a music streaming site that allowed you to broadcast what you were listening to to others and chat in the broadcasts</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:35 PM<br>
  </em>what kind of things did you chat about in broadcasts?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:36 PM<br>
  </em>in that case i have this screenshot cus i think it's a hilarious relic and alsooo</p>
  <img class="imge" src="images/riley/image0.jpg">
  <p>that's a great question i guess we talked about anything and everything. school, anime, whatever music we were listening to, dating. i still have friends from there which is surreal and they're the only cishet men i've ever befriended on the internet. it was a shitty site and it was basically the wild west (unmodded and completely illegal which is why it doesn't exist anymore) but it was like my big start in trying to have a persona bc i was fairly popular</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:38 PM<br>
  </em>what would you say that persona was like?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:44 PM<br>
  </em>i've always gone by r names so my first persona went by rei and was very much the antithesis of everything i am now (but this is also pre a huge trauma so i don't know how much this might play into it). i was very much an extrovert, the mom friend, very quirky xD. i got into a fair amount of arguments over stupid shit i can't remember (notable only because i am so incredibly non confrontational now) i definitely made drama to be interesting and like heavily leaned into being LOUD and popular (in a way that was mostly affected) it's so stupid how kids are on the internet i feel like everyone starts out screaming into the void as loudly as they can<em><br>
  </em>quirky xD as a phrase i did not genuinely use that emoji</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:45 PM<br>
  </em>it really do be like that! a lot of the time it felt like you had to be loud to exist online<em><br>
  </em>what kind of friends did you make with that persona?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:51 PM<br>
  </em>cishet ones and people who i would Never interact with if i met them today. one of them is now in the marines and the other one is a pretty severe meth addict. which you know some judgement to the first guy but otherwise it's just not the kind of people you meet in my current communities. it was very much a different space and it's weird to think about.</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:52 PM<br>
  </em>do you still keep up with them? and how have you tailored your online experience today?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 5:56 PM<br>
  </em>i do keep up with both of them! we talk on <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/">snapchat</a> at least monthly and i talk to one of them like bi weekly which is such a strange thought. i have very much tailored my online experience to be an echo chamber (in a good way?). i don't seek out any discomfort because i dislike my day to day life and have for years so twitter is kind of a safe haven. i have toooons of words and people muted and i fully refuse to argue with anyone and people like that get straight up hard blocked - fyi this is not about just politics actually it's mostly not about politics but i also really dislike hearing repugnant political opinions and filter that shit out as best i can as i get older. my closest friends are people who are extremely similar to me which i guess is the difference im now seeing while thinking about it.<em><br>
  </em>i had a very unsafe 2 year long twitter friendship and since then i am just so quick to hard block when i'm not feeling it. everything is safe space for me when i'm in control and i mean that unironically</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 5:59 PM<br>
  </em>honestly that's probably really healthy in practice!</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 6:00 PM<br>
  </em>it can be but it also is an avoidant behavior and is sort of like when you're overly sanitary and never build up an immunity to germs and become so healthy you're unhealthy . it's a time bomb.</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 6:02 PM<br>
  </em>that's an interesting way to put it. do you feel like that's how others might perceive it, or are you worried about how it'll affect you?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 6:04 PM<br>
  </em>well it's definitely how i think my therapist would look at it if she comprehended it. i haven't ever really thought about it hard enough to perceive it at all so i guess it's how i think others perceive it but subconsciously i feel the danger. when i see people acting up irl it just becomes worse and worse and harder to handle with the passing time lol...i think lol safe space people also don't think about it hard enough to see it that way though ngl</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 6:06 PM<br>
  </em>that's very fair! its so easy to see when people have Too Online Disease</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 6:07 PM<br>
  </em>HAHA the clinical term...<em><br>
  </em>it's terminal :cry:</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 6:07 PM<br>
  </em>:pensive:<em><br>
  </em>at the same time, do you feel like you're better able to be more "genuine" to yourself online now that you've made a safe space for yourself?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 6:08 PM<br>
  </em>it's difficult because i feel like...not to go too far but it's like<em><br>
  </em>since i've been crafting myself personas since i was so young i can't tell the difference anymore and i have no way of telling who i would genuinely be online and who is crafted. there is such a major disconnect between my closeted irl self and my long time male online self that even if my behavior is genuine they're two people in my mind?? if that makes sense<em><br>
  </em>even in my dreams i hear two separate names and know of two separate selves that they imply???<em><br>
  </em>like if my girlfriend is there i'll be called riley and know how to respond and if my mother is there i'll be called emma and know how to respond.</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 6:13 PM<br>
  </em>that isn't too far at all!<em><br>
  </em>do you consider a "genuine" version of yourself different from something you can be either in person, and thus attached to your physical self, or one where you decide all the variables as your online self?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 6:18 PM<br>
  </em>i feel like it truly exists only in my mind because both social selves are affected but if i had to choose i would say my online self is closer. but only Just barely and only fairly recently ... this is interesting to think about. i think controlling the variables gives the power to be the true genuine self but the willpower required for that is a huge hurdle .....<em><br>
  </em>did i answer that right?</p>

  <p><strong>svvord </strong><em>Today at 6:18 PM<br>
  </em>oh yeah totally!<em><br>
  </em>what kind of hurdles do you consider there to be online?</p>

  <p><strong>riley </strong><em>Today at 6:22 PM<br>
  </em>i guess that i think that when given the opportunity to present yourself in any way you choose because you're starting from blank it is harder to do it genuinely than it is to lie or exaggerate or purposefully paint a picture. especially if you're trying to make friends or build a following aka attract attention. it's hard to paint yourself unobjectively in general but it's even harder under this circumstance i think</p>
